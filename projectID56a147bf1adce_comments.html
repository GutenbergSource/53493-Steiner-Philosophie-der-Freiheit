<HTML><BODY>Before Rudolf Steiner became openly involved in occultism, he pursued a career in literature and philosophy, and published this work, which he, also at a later age, considered his most important work.

<p>When he joined the Theosophical movement in 1900, and later moved on to found Anthroposophy, his further works became more focused on his occult ideas based on clairvoyance, by which he in effect placed himself outside the realm of mainstream philosophy.

<p>This is the original first printing; this work was reprinted in 1918 with some modifications. The ebook versions of this work you can find on-line are based on these later revisions.

<p>The book is in German, but printed in a modern font, so poses little difficulties. 

<p>For the opening and close quotes, please use the common quotation mark (") instead of the low double comma. Please do not use guillemets (Gänsefüßchen), except if they actually appear in the work.

<p>Please do not modernize the spelling. Keep old spellings as they are in the original!

<p>When you encounter the long s (&#383;) followed by a normal s, please just use ß for the combination, so proof, for example, da&#383;s as daß, not as dass.
